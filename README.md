  - **Spring Data JPA** is used to interact with **PostgreSQL**, making database operations seamless.  

- **Authentication & Authorization**:  
  - Implements **Spring Security** with **JWT authentication**, ensuring secure user logins.  
  - Uses **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict endpoints based on user roles (**Admin, Handler, User**).  

- **Database Management (PostgreSQL)**:  
  - Stores **users, complaints, check-ins, and check-outs** in a structured manner.  
  - Uses **Spring Data JPA** for efficient querying and persistence.  

- **Complaint Tracking System**:  
  - Users can log complaints, which are assigned to handlers for resolution.  
  - Handlers update the status of complaints as they progress.  

- **Check-In & Check-Out Handling**:  
  - Guests and inmates can be checked in and out through dedicated services, maintaining a history of movements.
